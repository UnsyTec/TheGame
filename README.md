# TheGame
If I had more time, I would:
* Move the code that I placed in the program class into a separate class
* More testing around the afore mentioned code
* Add the ability to configure the number of points a correct guess would be worth
* Utilize the MinNumber and MaxNumber configuration options for the random number range
* Tidy up the code a little
* Improve the on-screen messages

My approach to this started off as BDD, however, in order to keep the time taken to a minimum, and
get the rest of the game working, I sacrificed the additional tests.

##Note:
When writing production code, I would NOT just skip writing the tests. Testing is a vital part of professional
software development in order to ensure that we can have confidence in our code.
